# Team 2 — Environment Setup and Collaboration Test

## Purpose
This repository is used to verify that our team can:
- Work from a shared codebase
- Clone and pull code from GitHub
- Edit code and documentation locally in VS Code
- Run a basic Node.js program
- Commit and push changes using Git
- Demonstrate a working development environment

This does not represent final project functionality.

## Tools Required
To run this project, each team member needs:
- VS Code (IDE)
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
- Git (version control)
- GitHub account

## Getting Started (First Time Only)
1. Open a terminal.
2. Clone the repository:

```text
git clone https://github.com/SWEN-661-Team-2/team2-hello-world
```
3. Open the folder in VS Code:
- File → Open Folder... → select the cloned project folder

## Day-to-Day Workflow (After Cloning)
Before making new changes, pull the latest code:

```text
git pull
```

## Running the Program
In a terminal inside the project folder:

```text
node index.js
```

Expected output will include:
- The initial Team 2 message
- One message line per team member

## Contribution Workflow
1. Pull latest changes: git pull
2. Make updates in VS Code
3. Stage changes: git add .
4. Commit with a descriptive message: git commit -m "<summary>"
5. Push changes: git push

## Team Members
- James Stevens
- Corey Bayliss

- (Each Team Member adds their name here.)

## Repository Contents
- index.js — simple "Hello World" style program that prints team messages
- README.md — documentation for cloning, running, and collaborating

## Status
This test confirms:
- The development environment is working
- The repository is set up correctly
- Members can clone, push and pull from the repository
- The team understands the technical collaboration workflow

Additional functionality will be developed in future phases.
